# Sparks-Internship-Tasks-in-Data-Science
I am thrilled to reflect on my #datascience #internship2023 at The Sparks Foundation, where I worked on fascinating projects and built my skills in #dataanalytics, #machinelearning, and more. In this post, I'll share some impactful projects I contributed to and the insights I gained from the experience.

## I've finished some tasks like:

1- Building a regression model to predict student scores based on their studying hours.

2- Using the #kmeans algorithm to classify iris flowers based on their characteristics. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in clustering and learned how to #visualizedata and interpret the results effectively.

3- Develop a #classification model with a decision tree to predict the type of Iris, and visualize the final tree. This project taught me how to approach and solve a classification problem using a #decision_ #internship, and how to optimize the model accuracy by using the #RandomForestClassifier model to get the most voted category of k trees.

4- Predicting the #Stock #Market prices of Microsoft #Financial public data in Yahoo Finance, using the #lstm technique. Through this project, I gained experience in #timeseriesanalysis and model selection. I also learned how to evaluate the performance of the model using #metrics such as mean squared error, and learned how to deal with #layers and their units in #deeplearning.

5- Conducting #sentimentanalysis on headline news of Indian newspapers. Through this project, I learned how to deal with #strings/text data and make some #nlp #tasks. To train before doing this task I learned #NLTK and some of #Spacy in Real Python to understand the fundamentals of #nlp.
because the headlines are short #strings so then I used a pre-trained model called #vader to analyze and get polarity scores of all headlines.

Finally, Next Step I will continue to solve many tasks of this internship later.
